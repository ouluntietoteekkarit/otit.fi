## General information

Our cozy guild room is located in the X doors corridor, near the X2 door, in a bomb shelter. The clearly visible signs guide you to the door, so that you can find the way just by keeping your eyes open. As you approach, you can feel the warm and friendly energy emanating from within, often caused by the rather tropical climate created by the concourse of members inside. In the main room, there’s a board game table with six rather comfortable leather chairs, a large divan sofa in front of a sizable TV, and, of course, our pool table in the middle of it all. In the back room you can find a meeting table and a smaller table with a sofa.
There’s a plethora of activities in the guild room, including a pool table, a 4K resolution 65" TV, Super Nintendo, GameCube, Sega, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Xbox, board games, a media-PC, a coffee maker, a microwave and a fridge.

## Pool table

The guild members are active pool players, which is why the table is almost always in use. The guild offers two options for using the table: a yearly subscription for 5 euros or a one-time payment of 20 cents per game. Additionally, the guild organizes competitions to determine the best players within the guild.

## Media-PC

The wall-mounted Media-PC is at your disposal, allowing you to freely enjoy music while, for example, playing pool. The PC comes with Spotify installed, and the guild has its own Spotify account, readily available for use.

## Kitchenette

Our well-equipped kitchenette includes coffee machine with step-by-step instructions for your convenience. Additionally, a variety of snacks are available for purchase at the bar counter, and the fridge is stocked with a selection of refreshing non-alcoholic beverages for sale. The fridge can also be used to store your own snacks and beverages, although do so at your own risk.

## Good company

At our guild room, you'll find nothing but the most awesome company! Don't worry, no monsters lurking here, although some might say so. Our guild room is the perfect spot to hang out with your friends or make new ones – whether you need study advice or just want to chill out.
