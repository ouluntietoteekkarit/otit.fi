**Annual Celebration** (or _vujut_) is the most important and prestigious celebration of every student association.
It is an academic dinner party where the association's members, alumni, partners and invited guests
gather together to celebrate the organization's founding, aging and continued activities.
Annual celebrations stand out from ordinary student events with their dignity:
they usually include a multi-course dinner, speeches, songs and other traditional program numbers.

OTiT traditionally organizes annual celebrations every five years and during jubilee years, which are powers of two (e.g. 32).
In 2025, OTiT will organize for the first time in its history interim annual celebrations to honor its 37th year of operation.

Annual celebrations and the following sillis are usually intended for **second-year students** and older members.
However, freshmen can participate in the annual celebration atmosphere during the celebration week events and as workforce for the annual celebrations.
Working as workforce offers **three (3) freshman points** for participating in annual celebrations, plus additional points based on hours worked.

### Course of the celebration day
The annual celebration day often begins with a **cocktail event** or "kokkari", where invited guests leave their greetings to the association's current board.
The cocktail event usually invites representatives from other subject associations, the association's former boards, honorary members,
partners and other actors. As the name suggests, the event offers drinks and small snacks.

After the cocktail event, the day culminates in a celebration dinner. At the **main celebration**, a three-course dinner is usually enjoyed
seasoned with appropriate refreshments. In addition to dinner, the main celebration features speeches, performances and awards.
In addition to these, an essential part of the main celebration is the communal singing of drinking songs familiar from sitsit, led by ceremony masters.
You can also make song requests to the ceremony masters if you wish.

After the main celebration, the celebration venue moves to continue the evening at the after-party, whose location will be revealed during the evening.
The **after-party** is the relaxed part of the annual celebration day, so you can loosen your bow tie and enjoy the evening's atmosphere more freely!
The after-party offers drinks, small snacks and performances or other entertainment.

The day after the annual celebrations, a **herring breakfast** or _sillis_ is organized, where tired celebrants are offered relief from the intense celebration day
in the form of breakfast, company and refreshments.

### Annual celebration etiquette

As a formal occasion, annual celebrations follow certain etiquette rules that are good to consider when preparing for the celebration and during the celebration.
However, it's important to remember that what makes the annual celebration dignified are primarily the celebration guests and good atmosphere. Etiquette is meant as a guide
whose knowledge helps understand traditions related to the celebration and thus get the most out of the magical event.
Following etiquette shouldn't be nervously worried about – good manners will get you far.

#### Behavior
During speeches, remarks and performances, the speaker and performer must be respected. During these times, it's not appropriate to talk, eat or drink.
Particularly disapproved is getting up from one's seat during performances or speeches. Returning to one's seat is courteous to time according to good manners
to the end of the performance or remark. After speeches, it's customary to raise a toast. **Toasting** is done by first raising your glass to the person seated **diagonally to your right**,
then to the person **diagonally to your left**, and finally to the person **opposite** of you. It is good manners to make eye contact with the person toward whom you raise your glass.
