Clubs of OTiT are activities by volunteer guild members to other guild members. Clubs are groups that gather regularly around a specific interest or activity. There can be many types of clubs, such as a cooking club, a football club, or a book club—only imagination is the limit! All members are welcome to participate in club activities!

The club's activities are managed by a club host, who is responsible for things like meetings and the program. The guild board assists in problem situations, but is not responsible for the club's operations.

## Current clubs

OTiT's Mahjong Club
We gather in the guild room every other monday starting 8.9.2025 at 18:00.
Club host: dolmio (TG: @datadrako1)
Please ask the info channel link from the host.

## Do you want to host a club?

Any guild member who wishes to host a club may do so. Guild's board can support club activities like advertising the club on guild's Telegram and email lists, provide funding for small events or purchases, but the club needs approval first from the board. The club may start its activities before approval from the board.
Please fill [this form](https://forms.gle/4Qi4tw1aWFWP2AsQ6), if you want to host a club or bring a written Club Application, which includes the tentative club plan, to a board member or board meeting.

The Club Application and Club Plan should include the following:

- Club's name
- What the club is about
- Club’s host
- Club host's point of contact
- Club's primary information channel (Like a Telegram chat)
- Tentative club plan
  - When does the club gather around? (For example, every other Monday at 16:30 or first Tuesday of each month at 7:00)
  - Club's tentative program (can be the same for each gathering)

## For hosts

Some useful info and tips for the hosts.

- Every guild member is welcome to join the club, but if there are any problems, please contact guild’s board or harassment contact person, or fill the harassment report
- Stick to the schedule. If there are changes to the club's schedule, inform about it well in advance.
- It's a good idea to recruit co-hosts who can run the club's activities in case of illness or other unavoidable commitments.
- Create at least a small plan for each club session. It makes the flow smoother. For example, if the club is discussion-based, think of topics in advance.
- The guild can assist with small material purchases or sponsor a sauna space for celebratory events. Ask the board for more details!
- The club can be ended at any time, but please inform the board about it.
