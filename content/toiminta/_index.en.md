The guild organises various fun activities for its members, such as parties, get-togethers and open sports hall sessions. The guild room is a common space for all members to hang out, study and find like-minded company. The guild also offers the possibility to make an account to our own shell server, otitsunii.oulu.fi, where you can chat using IRC and host your own web pages.
