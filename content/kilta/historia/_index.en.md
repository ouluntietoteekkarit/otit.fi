The history of Oulun Tietoteekkarit ry dates all the way back to 1988, precisely to September 26th, when the guild's founding meeting was held. The specialization option for Computer science within the Electrical engineering program started in 1985, and the official Computer science and Engineering program was approved by the Ministry of Education a couple of years later. The program for Computer science and Engineering was decided to commence from August 1st, 1988.

Since its establishment, the guild's most important task was to act as a liaison between the ever-growing student community of Computer Science and Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering. As an organization advocating for students' interests, the guild has also taken a stance on issues of concern to students. From the very beginning, maintaining good and functional relations with the department and its staff, even on a personal level, was considered highly important. This ensured effective interaction between students and the department, leading to collaborative efforts that improved the quality of education.

During the guild's founding meeting, a decision was made to acquire a printer to serve as a financial asset for the guild. Placed in a high traffic location, the printer saw significant usage, generating substantial revenue for the guild despite its reasonable copying prices compared to others.
