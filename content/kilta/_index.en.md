Oulun Tietoteekkarit ry is a student guild for the Computer Science and Engineering students of the University of Oulu, founded in 1988. The guild brings together older students and freshmen alike, and organizes various fun activities on their own and also with other student guilds. The guild is run by a yearly-elected board with the support of appointed officials.

The guild organises various fun activities for its members, such as excursions and sauna-evenings. The guild publishes its own magazine called 'Terminaali' about 4 times a year, that serves as an outlet for the guild members to get their voices heard and share their stories for other members to read. The freshman edition of Terminaali, published at the very beginning of each autumn, introduces new freshmen to the basics of guild activities and student life at the university.

The guild room, located in the X doors corridor near the X2 door in a bomb shelter, acts as a meeting place for the guild members. Inside, you can find plenty of different activities, such as video games, board games and books, and enjoy the company of other guild members.
