The harassment report form of Oulun Tietoteekkarit is now available! This is a low-threshold
channel where you can contact the guild’s harassment contact persons.  

The form can be filled out completely anonymously if you only wish to report an incident – in this
case, however, we will not be able to contact you.  

OTiT’s harassment contact persons have completed the harassment contact person training
organized by OYY and act based on that training. Their role is not to punish the person accused
of harassment or to serve as a personal therapist for the affected individual; rather, their
purpose is to help move the matter forward.
