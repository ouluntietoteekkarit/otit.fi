OTY organizes a wide range of events for freshmen throughout the year, examples of which are on this page. Guilds and other organizations also host many freshman activities, for which you can ask your small group tutor or your guild’s freshman representative for more information.

**TUTORial**

Our guild's own event, traditionally held on the Saturday before the Monday when studies begin. The event offers a relaxed setting to get to know other freshmen, tutors, board members, and possibly older students before the start of studies.

**Freshman Info**

An event held at the beginning of the fall where various associations introduce themselves to freshmen. Here, you'll get to know your guild's board and discover different hobby opportunities and more that Oulu has to offer.

**Freshman Orienteering**

A scavenger hunt organized by OTY for small groups within the fields of technology and architecture, designed to boost group spirit and compete for victory with the most creative performances. Freshman orienteering is the first major freshman event of the academic year, taking place in mid-September. Each orienteering event has its own theme. Costumes and team spirit also contribute to the scoring. The best teams are awarded, but the main goal is for everyone to have fun. It's advisable to have a bicycle, as the checkpoints are often spread between Linnanmaa and the city center.

**Freshman Sitsit**

An event where freshmen are taught what it's like to attend an academic dinner party, known as "sitsit."

**HURMOS**

An event organized by OYY and OSAKO to mark the beginning of the academic year, consisting of both daytime and evening events. During the day, companies present themselves at the university, trying to attract future employees for the next summer. The evening event consists of partying and music performances.

**Freshman Capping Ceremony and Cap Descending Celebration**

The Freshman Capping Ceremony happens on the same day as the Cap Descending Celebration, traditionally held on the last day of September. On this day, all freshmen receive their freshman caps, which are used to practice the rules associated with the Teekkari cap and its proper use. The cap ceremony takes place in downtown Oulu. More information on the history of the freshman cap can be found in the guide for freshmen.

**Freshman Excursion**

The freshmen’s very own and first excursion, held in fall.

**Freshman Sports Competitions**

In the Freshman Sports Competitions, freshmen compete against each other in teams of three in various playful athletic tasks. The competitions are held in Linnanmaa in early fall, followed by singing and sauna at Teekkaritalo during the Freshman Singing Night.

**Freshman Singing Night**

Teekkari is known for singing more enthusiastically than well. Therefore, it's good to practice the songs in our beloved songbook Laulukalu even as a freshman. At the Freshman Singing Night, you’ll learn to sing the most important songs for a Teekkari and also songs requested by freshmen, all guided by the Culture Pig. The Freshman Singing Night is traditionally held in early fall at Teekkaritalo after the Freshman Sports Competitions.

**Freshman Kyykkä**

An introduction to the secrets of Academic Kyykkä, organized by the guild. Traditionally held in January in collaboration with SIK and YRK.

**Snow Sculpting Competition**

Held in early spring, the Snow Sculpture Competition puts guilds against each other to create sculptures from snow. Each year, the event has a different theme, and the sculptures should ideally relate to that theme.

**KONE's Laskiainen**

A big winter party organized by the Mechanical Engineering students. The day starts with sledding in Raksila and culminates in bar parties in the evening.

**The Day of Otto**

The start of Wappu, beginning on Otto’s name day. On April 17th, OTY’s Freshman Committee traditionally organizes some fun activities for freshmen.

**Freshman Swimmings**

The highlight of Waatto for freshmen, where the freshman who has grown during the year finally "dies" as they slide down a slide into Lasaretinväylä.

**Wappu**

Wappu is like Christmas, Midsummer, and New Year all piled into one for a Teekkari. During Wappu, freshmen (symbolically) die and are reborn as Teekkari. Wappu week features countless events, such as Church Boat Races and the Ööpis Gala. Wappu week culminates on Waatto with the freshmen’s baptism event and the Waatto party. Early on Wappu morning, new Teekkaris get to put on their brand-new Teekkari caps. On the evening of Wappu Day, the freshman caps are laid to rest with dignity in the Freshman Cap Cremation at Teekkaritalo.
